AdMediation - Assignment

# Create and Deploy App
- Go to google cloud platform and open App Engine in Console
- Create a new project and within it a new folder called admediation on path /home/{your_user}/gopath/src/admediation
- Copy files admediation.go, app.yaml and output.txt in the before created folder
- Import all needed imports: <br/>
`$ go get github.com/gorilla/mux`<br/>
`$ go get github.com/thedevsaddam/gojsonq`
- Run command `$ gcloud app deploy`
- Run command `$ gcloud app browse` to see the URL where the App runs

# Assumptions
- For added logic `AdMob doesn’t work on any android os version 9 so it should be returned to the app, but works on other os versions`, assumed it meant shouldn't and not should
- No database was created to save the values, everything is saved in `output.txt`
- When Query-ing data and the response is empty, the response is replaced with a list of all Ad Networks (if the parameter platform was used in Query, the response is also Query-ed to that platform)
